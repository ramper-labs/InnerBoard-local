- Use lowercase keys exactly as shown.
- Each field is an array of strings.
- 2–5 items per array; 1 sentence per item; 8–20 words.
- Derive items from the provided insights in JSON format; do not invent facts.
- team_update: peer-friendly progress and next focus, optionally include light emojis if appropriate.
- manager_update: outcomes, risks, blockers, resourcing needs, and timelines at a high level.
- recommendations: concrete, actionable next steps starting with a strong verb.
- Avoid duplicate items; be specific; no placeholders.
